# Overview

The self-esteem program evaluates and helps the user to have a quick overview of their situation. 
Although it does not count as professional help, it provides a better awareness of the possible consequences of 
not treating the self-esteem problem. Not to mention that the program also allows saving the information in a text file, 
giving the user easier access.

This program is developed to help everyone to understand the importance of treating low self-esteem. 
It also motivates everyone to seek professional help.
